## Github Action secrets.PAT

This is the personal access token for the github repository and It is used to:

- Push the MKDocs documentation to the `gh-pages` branch.
- Push the pre-commit autoupdate to the `main` branch.

How to configure the secrets.PAT:

- Create in github a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta),for the specific repository. [How](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)
- Give it read/write access to "Contents", "Pull Requests" and "Workflows" under the "Repository Permissions" section.
- Add de PAT to the repository secrets. Go to the repository settings > Secrets and variables > Actions. THen in Repository secrets add a new repository secret and Name it `PAT` and paste the token.
