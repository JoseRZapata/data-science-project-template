# üõ†Ô∏è Local Dev environment setup

I develop data science python projects in Linux OS or MAC OS. (For Windows OS I recommend [WSL] and run commands as Linux OS).

I setup my local development environment using the following steps:

## üíª Computer setup to develop with Python

1. Install [Git]
      - Linux: `sudo apt-get install git`
      - MAC: `brew install git`
2. Install [Make]
      - Linux: `sudo apt-get install make`
      - MAC: `brew install make`
3. Install [Pyenv] and after install set up the terminal for [Pyenv] - [Link to set up](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv)
      - Linux: `curl https://pyenv.run | bash`
      - MAC: `brew install pyenv`
      - **Check the installation version** executing in terminal: `pyenv --version` for help go to [pyenv installation help](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#set-up-your-shell-environment-for-pyenv)
4. Install [Python] using [Pyenv] , at this time I am using Python 3.11 (in Future, i recommend to use [UV] to manage the python versions)
      - `pyenv install 3.11` # Install Python 3.11 in computer
      - `pyenv global 3.11` # Set Python 3.11 as global version
      - **Check the installation version** executing in terminal: `python --version`
5. Install locally [UV] to Install and Run Python Applications in Isolated Environments
      - Linux:

        ```bash title="Install uv in Linux or MACOS"
        curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
        ```

        - Check the installation version executing in terminal: `uv version`

## üêç General Python tools

General Tools that I use to develop Python projects, The most important is [Poetry] and all this tools are installed using [UV] to have this tools in isolated environments, because applications runs in its own virtual environment to avoid dependencies conflicts and they are available everywhere.

1. [Poetry] to manage the dependencies and the virtual environment of the project.
      - `uv tool install poetry`
2. [Cruft] allows you to maintain all the necessary boilerplate for packaging and building projects separate from the code you intentionally write. Fully compatible with existing Cookiecutter templates.
      - `uv tool install cruft`
3. (optional) [Pip-audit] to local check the security of the dependencies of the project.
      - `uv tool install pip-audit`
4. (optional) [Actionlint] to check the syntax of the GitHub Actions configuration files of the project.
      - `uv tool install actionlint`

**Note:** [UV] is a tool that wants to replace the need of [Pyenv], [Poetry] and other ones. So is very possible that in the future I will use [UV] to manage the python versions, enviroments and dependencies.

## üìÅ Start a new data science project

1. Start a new project using the [Cruft] with the [Data Science Project Template].

    ```shell title="create project"
    cruft create https://github.com/JoseRZapata/data-science-project-template
    ```

2. Answer the questions to create the project.
3. Run `make init_env` to init [Git] and [Poetry]. Or You can do the same running this commands:

    ```shell title="init environment"
        git init -b main
        poetry install
        poetry run pre-commit install
        git add .
        git commit -m "üéâ Begin a project, Initial commit"
        poetry shell
    ```

4. üéâ Congrats Start coding your project.
