## 📁 Creating a New Project

### 👍 Recommendations

It is highly recommended to use managers for the python versions, dependencies and virtual environments.

This project uses [UV], a extremely fast tool to replace [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), pip-tools, [Pipx], [Poetry], [Pyenv], twine, [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), and more.

🌟 Check how to setup your environment: <https://joserzapata.github.io/data-science-project-template/local_setup/>

### 🍪🥇 Via [Cruft] - (**recommended**)

```bash title="install cruft"
# Install cruft in a isolated environment using uv

uv tool install cruft 

# Or Install with pip

pip install --user cruft # Install `cruft` on your path for easy access
```

```shell title="create project"
cruft create https://github.com/JoseRZapata/data-science-project-template
```

### 🍪 Via [Cookiecutter]

```shell title="install cookiecutter"

uv tool install cookiecutter # Install cruft in a isolated environment

# Or Install with pip

pip install --user cookiecutter # Install `cookiecutter` on your path for easy access
```

```shell title="create project"
cookiecutter gh:JoseRZapata/data-science-project-template
```

Note: **_Cookiecutter_** uses `gh:` as short-hand for `https://github.com/`

## 🔗  Linking an Existing Project

If the project was originally installed via [Cookiecutter], you must first use [Cruft] to link the project with the original template:

```shell
cruft link https://github.com/JoseRZapata/data-science-project-template
```

Then/else:

```shell
cruft update
```

## ✨ Features and Tools

### 🚀 Project Standardization and Automation

#### 🔨 Developer Workflow Automation

- Python packaging, dependency management and environment management
  with [UV] - [`why use a management, (uv is a replacement for poetry)`](https://codecut.ai/poetry-a-better-way-to-manage-python-dependencies/)
- Project workflow orchestration
  with [Make] as an [interface shim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing))
    - Self-documenting [Makefile](https://github.com/JoseRZapata/data-science-project-template/blob/main/{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}/Makefile); just type
      `make` on the command line to display auto-generated documentation on available
      targets:
- Automated Cookiecutter template synchronization with [Cruft] - [`why?`](https://careers.wolt.com/en/blog/tech/project-template-for-modern-python-packages)
- Code quality tooling automation and management with [pre-commit]
- Continuous integration and deployment with [GitHub Actions]
- Project configuration files  with [Hydra] - [`why?`](https://codecut.ai/stop-hard-coding-in-a-data-science-project-use-configuration-files-instead/)

#### 🌱 Conditionally Rendered Python Package or Project Boilerplate

- _Optional:_ [Jupyter] support

### 🔧 Maintainability

#### 🏷️  Type Checking and Data Validation

- Static type-checking with [Mypy]

#### ✅ 🧪 Testing/Coverage

- Testing with [Pytest]
- Code coverage with [Coverage.py]
- Coverage reporting with [Codecov]

#### 🚨 Linting

##### 🔍 Code quality

- [Ruff] An extremely fast (10x-100x faster) Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust.
    - Replacement for ~~[Pylint]~~, ~~[Flake8]~~ (including major plugins) and more linters under a single, common interface
- [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck)
- Unsanitary commits:
    - Secrets with [`detect-secrets`](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets)
    - Large files with [`check-added-large-files`](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks#check-added-large-files)
    - Files that contain merge conflict strings.[check-merge-conflict](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks?tab=readme-ov-file#check-merge-conflict)

##### 🎨 Code formatting

- [Ruff] An extremely fast (10x-100x faster) Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust.

- This is a replacement for [pip-audit](https://github.com/pypa/pip-audit) , _In your local environment, If you want to check for vulnerabilities in your dependencies you can use [pip-audit]_.

##### Dependency Review in PR

- Dependency Review  with [dependency-review-action], This action scans your pull requests for dependency changes, and will raise an error if any vulnerabilities or invalid licenses are being introduced.

##### Pre-commit automatic updates

- Automatic updates with [GitHub Actions] workflow `.github/workflows/pre-commit_autoupdate.yml`

## 🔒 Security

### 🔏 Static Application Security Testing (SAST)

Makefile to automate the setup of your environment, the installation of dependencies, the execution of tests, etc.
in terminal type `make` to see the available commands

```bash
Target                Description
-------------------   ----------------------------------------------------
check                 Run code quality tools with pre-commit hooks.
docs_test             Test if documentation can be built without warnings or errors
docs_view             Build and serve the documentation
init_env              Install dependencies with uv and activate env
init_git              Initialize git repository
install_data_libs     Install pandas, scikit-learn, Jupyter, seaborn
pre-commit_update     Update pre-commit hooks
test                  Test the code with pytest and coverage
```

### 📝 Project Documentation

- Documentation building
  with [MkDocs] - [Tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-project-documentation-with-mkdocs/)
    - Powered by [mkdocs-material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material)
    - Rich automatic documentation from type annotations and docstrings (NumPy, Google, etc.)
    with [mkdocstrings]
